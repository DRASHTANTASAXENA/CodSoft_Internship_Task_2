# CodSoft_Internship_Task_2
Projects and assignments completed during CodSoft Data Science Internship, including data analysis, visualization, and machine learning implementations.

#Data Science Internship Projects
This repository contains four modular machine learning projects developed for internship review. Each project demonstrates end‑to‑end workflows including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and reproducible pipelines.

#🚀 Projects Overview
|🎬 Movie Rating Prediction | Predicts user ratings for movies based on metadata and user behavior. | Regression modeling, feature encoding, train‑test split, evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE). |

# ▶️ Usage
# Titanic survival prediction
python titanic_survival/main.py

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics
Movie Rating Prediction: RMSE, MAE, R²

# 📌 Notes
Each project is modularized into preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation scripts. Code logic matches notebook workflows for transparency and reproducibility. Shared utilities are placed in the common/ folder for consistency. All datasets are either synthetic or publicly available.
